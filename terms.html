      <h2>TERMS & CONDITIONS</h2>
      <p>
        These terms of use are entered into by and between you and Fair Fractal
        Corp. (“Company”, “we” or “us”). The following Terms and Conditions
        (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of Scan2Pay’s products and
        services, including our website, user interface and mobile wallet
        application (“Scan2Pay Wallet”), and any other related services or
        products (collectively referred to as the “Product”). By accessing or
        using any part of the Product, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If
        you do not agree, please discontinue your use of the Product
        immediately.
      </p>

      <h3>1. Access</h3>
      <p>
        By accessing or using our Product you represent and warrant that you are
        at least 18 years of age and able to form a legally binding contract
        with us. If you are under the age of 18 years of age, you must not use
        the Product.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your access to and/or use of any Product is subject to these Terms
        herein and all applicable laws and regulations. By accessing, attempting
        to access and/or using our Product, you accept and agree to abide by
        these Terms. If you do not accept and agree to these Terms, please do
        not use our Product.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Modifications</h3>
      <p>
        We reserve the right to modify these Terms, at our sole discretion from
        time to time. If we make any material modifications, we will notify you
        by updating the date at the top of the Terms, as indicated above. We
        reserve the right to modify, substitute, eliminate, or add to the
        Product; or review, modify, filter, disable, delete and remove any and
        all content and information from the Product.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Our Product</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Interface:</strong><br />
        The Product provides web and mobile access to a decentralised protocol
        on the Base Blockchain, which is a Layer 2 solution built on the
        Ethereum Blockchain. This Protocol enables users to interact directly
        with one another in a peer-to-peer manner. Our product only facilitates
        crypto to crypto transactions and all fiat based transactions happen
        outside of our Product.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Product is separate from the Protocol and serves as one of several
        means to access it. The Protocol consists of three distinct versions,
        designated as v1, v2, and v3, each comprising open-source,
        self-executing smart contracts deployed across various public
        blockchains, including Polygon, Base, and Ethereum. We do not control or
        operate any version of the Protocol. The Protocol has been developed as
        a public good by an anonymous cohort of developers.
      </p>

      <p>
        By engaging in the buying and selling of digital assets and fiat
        currencies and swapping between the two, you acknowledge that these
        transactions are not conducted with us. We do not operate any liquidity
        pools or control trade execution on the Protocol. All trades are
        executed by third parties, and liquidity pools are managed independently
        by such third parties, we only provide an interface.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Protocol is not the Product. We do not control the Protocol and as a
        result of which you acknowledge and willfully undertake the inherent
        risks associated with the use of the Product.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Scan2Pay Wallet:</strong><br />
        To access the Product, you must use a non-custodial wallet, the
        cryptographic private keys of which are retained solely by you. This
        means you maintain full control and ownership of your digital assets at
        all times. We do not have control over, nor do we have access to, the
        non-custodial wallets that you create on our platform. Please note that
        your use of the wallet will be governed by these Terms and Third Web’s
        terms and privacy policy.
      </p>

      <p>
        You hold the private keys and are therefore solely responsible for the
        security, management and ownership of your wallet and associated funds.
        We cannot recover your wallet or assist in the retrieval of any lost or
        forgotten private keys. It is your sole responsibility to ensure that
        your wallet is secured against unauthorised access.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Other Product:</strong><br />
        We may from time to time, in the future, offer additional products, and
        such additional products shall be considered a Product as used herein
        regardless of whether such product is defined in the Terms.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Sharing</h3>
      <p>
        We do not collect or share any personal information, except for wallet
        addresses and telegram usernames of liquidity providers. Your telegram
        username and profile information including reputation points and
        on-chain transactions are publicly available data. We have visibility
        over other aspects of the transactions between the users which occur
        off-chain.
      </p>
      <p>
        We reserve the right to revoke access to your account and deduct
        reputation points at our sole discretion, based on your on-chain
        activity and transaction history thereby limiting your ability to
        interact with the Protocol. Further, access to your account may be
        restricted in order to comply with legal requirements as per court
        orders.
      </p>

      <h3>5. Intellectual Property</h3>
      <p>
        The Company owns worldwide right, title and interest, including all
        intellectual property and other proprietary rights, in and to the
        Product and its associated usage including functionality, design,
        software, appearance and compilation of all information, images and
        content.
      </p>

      <h3>6. Acceptable Use</h3>
      <p>
        You may use our Product subject to these Terms. You agree to not engage
        in or attempt the following categories of activities: Intellectual
        Property Infringement, Fraud, Unauthorized Access, Disruption of
        Services, Illegal Activity, Data Mining, and more as fully described
        above.
      </p>

      <h3>7. No Warranty</h3>
      <p>
        The Product is provided on an “as-available” and “as-is” basis, without
        any warranties of any kind. Your access to and use of our Product is
        permitted solely at our discretion. We make no warranties, whether
        express, implied or statutory, including, but not limited to, the
        warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose,
        non-infringement, or any other warranties arising from a course of
        performance, dealing, or trade usage. We do not represent or warrant
        that any features or functionalities of our Product will be available,
        uninterrupted, or error-free, that any defects will be corrected, or
        that the Product will be free from hacking, ransomware,
        denial-of-service attacks, viruses, or other malicious code. You accept
        all risks associated with using our Product, including risks of
        temporary unavailability, data corruption, or loss of access to your
        assets or data. We do not endorse, guarantee, or assume responsibility
        for any advertisements, offers, or statements made by third parties
        concerning any of our Products. We do not own, or control the Protocol,
        which is run autonomously with the help of self-executing smart
        contracts on the blockchain and therefore no liability related to the
        functioning of the Protocol is attributable to us. This includes any
        direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages related to your
        use of the Protocol.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any payments or financial transactions that you engage in will be
        processed either at the Protocol level with the help of automated smart
        contracts or directly between users in a peer-to-peer manner. Once
        orders for transactions are placed, we have no control over these
        payments or transactions, nor do we have the ability to reverse any such
        transactions. You acknowledge that your data and assets on the Services
        may become irretrievably lost or corrupted or temporarily unavailable
        due to a variety of causes, including but not limited to
        denial-of-service attacks, software failures, viruses or other
        technologically harmful materials (including those which may infect your
        computer equipment or devices), protocol changes by third-party
        providers, internet outages, force majeure events, or other causes
        either within or outside of our control.
      </p>

      <h3>8. Compliances and Tax Obligations</h3>
      <p>
        The Product may not be available for use in your jurisdiction. By
        accessing or using the Product, you agree that you are solely
        responsible for ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and
        regulations in your jurisdiction.
      </p>
      <p>
        In particular, your use of our Product may have tax implications,
        including but not limited to income tax, goods and services tax, capital
        gains tax, sales tax, income tax and any other applicable taxes
        depending on your applicable jurisdiction. It is your sole
        responsibility to determine if taxes apply to any transactions, you
        initiate or receive, and to report, file, or remit the appropriate
        amounts to the relevant authorities.
      </p>
      <p>
        You acknowledge that we are not responsible for reporting, monitoring,
        or tracking your transactions. It is your sole responsibility to manage
        and fulfil any reporting or compliance obligations related to your
        transactions. Furthermore, you acknowledge that these transactions are
        facilitated by the Protocol, and we merely provide an interface to
        access the Protocol.
      </p>
      <h3>9. Liquidity Provider Specific Obligations</h3>
      <p>
        As a Liquidity Provider, you acknowledge and accept that you are
        independently responsible for all aspects of your participation. This
        includes ensuring compliance with all relevant laws and regulations in
        your jurisdiction, including but not limited to Anti-Money Laundering
        (AML) obligations, tax and other reporting requirements. Additionally,
        if you are a liquidity provider to the Protocol via the Product,
        withdrawing your crypto or undertaking transactions may also result in
        your bank accounts being frozen or restricted and there may be limited
        recourse available for such bank freeze. You agree that any liability
        arising from non-compliance with these obligations rests solely with
        you, and you understand that we neither monitor nor manage these
        requirements on your behalf. You confirm that you have joined the
        network voluntarily, without solicitation or encouragement from us, and
        that your engagement is entirely self-directed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Liquidity Providers are responsible for facilitating swaps between
        cryptocurrencies and fiat. All such transactions are conducted directly
        between Liquidity Providers and users without any involvement or
        oversight from us. As a result, we do not have visibility into these
        transactions, nor do we assume any liability for issues arising from
        them. Fiat settlements are conducted by Liquidity Providers through
        external channels that are beyond our control. We disclaim all
        responsibility for the legality, security, or outcomes of these
        transactions.
      </p>
      <p>
        By participating as a Liquidity Provider, you acknowledge that all risks
        and responsibilities associated with your activities rest entirely with
        you. We do not provide legal, regulatory, or financial advice and are
        not liable for any actions taken against you as a result of your
        participation. You confirm that you have been adequately aware of your
        responsibilities and agree to hold us harmless from any claims, losses,
        or liabilities arising from your activities within the network.
      </p>

      <h3>10. Errors, Inaccuracies, and Omissions</h3>
      <p>
        The Product may contain errors, inaccuracies, or omissions, particularly
        in Product descriptions, availability, credentials or usage. We reserve
        the right but are not obligated, to correct any such issues or update
        information at any time.
      </p>
      <p>
        By using our Product, you acknowledge that we cannot update, amend,
        delete, or restrict access to information users store on decentralised
        networks. While we have no obligation to modify or limit access to such
        information, we may do so at our discretion or when required by law.
      </p>
      <h3>11. Disclaimers and General Assumption of Risk</h3>
      <p>
        By accessing and using the Product, you represent that you are
        financially and technically sound enough to understand the inherent
        risks associated with using blockchain-based systems and products.
      </p>
      <p>
        You understand that smart contract transactions automatically execute
        and settle transactions and these transactions are irreversible in
        nature. Our Product relies on novel and emerging technologies, such as
        Ethereum and Base. Some offerings are subject to increased risk through
        your potential misuse of public/private key cryptography, or failing to
        properly update or run software to accommodate protocol upgrades. By
        using the Product, you explicitly acknowledge and accept these
        heightened risks. You further understand that protocols present their
        own risks of use, and that supporting or participating in the protocol
        may result in losses if your participation violates the specific rules
        of that protocol.
      </p>

      <h3>12. Limitation of Liability</h3>
      <p>
        You expressly agree to assume all the risks associated with accessing
        and using our Product. By doing so, you agree that we are not liable for
        any lost profits, revenues, goodwill, direct, indirect, punitive,
        incidental, special, cover, business interruption, punitive, or
        consequential damages arising from your use or inability to use our
        Product. This applies regardless of whether the claim is based on
        contract, tort, or any other legal theory, even if we were advised or
        had the knowledge of the possibility of such damages.
      </p>
      <p>
        We cannot and do not guarantee or warrant that files available for
        downloading from the internet or the Services will be free of viruses or
        other destructive code. You are responsible for implementing sufficient
        procedures and checkpoints to satisfy your particular requirements for
        anti-virus protection and accuracy of data input and output, and for
        maintaining a means external to our Services for any reconstruction of
        any lost data. We have no control over, take no responsibility for, and
        shall not be liable for the conduct of third parties, including threat
        actors. You further acknowledge and agree that we have no liability for
        the theft, loss, or compromise of your wallet keys or any other keys
        used to access digital wallets, nor for the consequences of any
        unauthorized access to your wallet or assets.
      </p>
      <p>
        To the fullest extent provided by law, in no event will we, our
        affiliates, or their licensors, service providers, employees, agents,
        officers, or directors be liable for damages of any kind, under any
        legal theory, arising out of or in connection with your use, or
        inability to use, the Services, any websites linked to it, or any
        content on the Services or such other websites. This includes, but is
        not limited to loss of revenue or anticipated savings, of data, or any
        other indirect, special, incidental, consequential, or punitive loss or
        damages. The foregoing does not affect any liability that cannot be
        excluded or limited under law.
      </p>

      <h3>13. Indemnification</h3>
      <p>
        By assessing or using our Product, you agree to indemnify, defend, and
        hold harmless the Company, our affiliates, officers, directors,
        employees, agents, licensors and suppliers from and against all losses,
        expenses, damages and costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees,
        arising or relating to (a) any violation of the applicable law; (b)
        these Terms; (c) any other third party use or access of our Product (d)
        your access or use of any of our Product; (e) any dispute between you
        and any other user of our Product or any of your customers or users.
      </p>

      <h3>14. Governing Law; Dispute Resolution</h3>
      <p>
        These Terms and any separate agreements whereby we provide you services,
        and any dispute or claim arising therefrom or related thereto (in each
        case, including non-contractual disputes, tortious claims or claims)
        shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
        Republic of Panama, without regard to principles of conflict of laws
        (whether of this or any other jurisdiction).
      </p>
      <p>
        In the event of any dispute, we will use our best efforts to resolve any
        potential disputes through informal, good-faith negotiations. If any
        potential dispute arises, you must contact us by sending us an email, so
        that we can attempt to resolve it without resorting to formal dispute
        resolutions. If we are not able to reach an information resolution
        within 90 days of your email, then you and we both agree to resolve such
        potential disputes according to the following process set forth below:
      </p>
      <p>
        Any controversy or dispute which arise out of these Terms must be
        decided by Arbitration, following an attempt at Conciliation,
        administered by the Panama Conciliation and Arbitration Centre (CECAP)
        in accordance with its procedural rules. The number of arbitrators shall
        be one. The seat, or legal place, of arbitration shall be Panama City.
        The language to be used in the arbitral proceedings shall be English.
        The governing law of the contract shall be the substantive law of the
        Republic of Panama. The arbitral award shall be final and binding on the
        Parties.
      </p>

      <h3>15. Severability</h3>
